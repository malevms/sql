Explanation                                                               
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  This request is eligible for incremental planning and execution (IPE).  
  The following is the static plan for the request.                       
   1) First, we lock D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_TSACTN_DTL in TD_MAP1 for access,    
      we lock D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_CHRG_DTL in TD_MAP1 for access, we lock     
      D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_AGG in TD_MAP1 for access on a single partition,    
      we lock D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_HIST in TD_MAP1 for access on a single      
      partition, we lock D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_PRCS_CNTRL in TD_MAP1 for        
      access on a single partition, we lock D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_PRCS_CNTRL    
      in TD_MAP1 for access on a single partition, we lock                
      D_IDW_INT.PRTY_INDIV_NAME in TD_MAP1 for access, we lock            
      D_IDW_INT.ENCTR_ADMSN in TD_MAP1 for access on a single partition,  
      we lock D_IDW_INT.ENCTR in TD_MAP1 for access on a single           
      partition, we lock D_IDW_INT.ENCTR_DIAGN in TD_MAP1 for access on   
      a single partition, we lock D_SHR_INT.TERM_MAP_GRP_FLTN in TD_MAP1  
      for access, we lock D_SHR_INT.TERM_MAP_FLTN in TD_MAP1 for access,  
      we lock D_SHR_INT.TERM in TD_MAP1 for access, and we lock           
      D_SHR_INT.TERM_MAP_GRP in TD_MAP1 for access.                       
   2) Next, we do a single-AMP RETRIEVE step from SYS_CALENDAR.CALDATES   
      by way of the unique primary index "SYS_CALENDAR.CALDATES.cdate =   
      DATE '2025-09-04'" with no residual conditions locking row for      
      access into Spool 3 (used to materialize view, derived table,       
      table function or table operator PERIOD_CALENDAR) (group_amps),     
      which is built locally on that AMP.  The size of Spool 3 is         
      estimated with high confidence to be 1 row (302 bytes).  The        
      estimated time for this step is 0.00 seconds.                       
   3) We do a group-AMP RETRIEVE step in TD_Map1 from Spool 3 (Last Use)  
      by way of an all-rows scan with a condition of (                    
      "PERIOD_CALENDAR.CALENDAR_DATE = DATE '2025-09-04'") into Spool 18  
      (all_amps), which is duplicated on all AMPs in TD_Map1.  The size   
      of Spool 18 is estimated with high confidence to be 440 rows (      
      7,480 bytes).  The estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds.    
   4) We do an all-AMPs JOIN step in TD_Map1 from Spool 18 by way of an   
      all-rows scan, which is joined to a single partition of             
      D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_HIST with a condition of (                          
      "D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_HIST.NAME_SPACE_CD = 'EPIC_TC-153'") with a        
      residual condition of ("(D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_HIST.EFF_THRU_DT >= DATE   
      '2025-09-04') AND ((D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_HIST.ENCTR_ID >= 1) AND         
      ((D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_HIST.NAME_SPACE_CD = 'EPIC_TC-153') AND           
      (D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_HIST.EFF_FROM_DT <= DATE '2025-09-04')))").        
      Spool 18 and D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_HIST are joined using a product join,  
      with a join condition of ("(CALENDAR_DATE <=                        
      D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_HIST.EFF_THRU_DT) AND (CALENDAR_DATE >=             
      D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_HIST.EFF_FROM_DT)").  The input table               
      D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_HIST will not be cached in memory, but it is        
      eligible for synchronized scanning.  The result goes into Spool 19  
      (all_amps), which is built locally on the AMPs.  Then we do a SORT  
      to order Spool 19 by row hash.  The size of Spool 19 is estimated   
      with no confidence to be 91,465 rows (4,115,925 bytes).  The        
      estimated time for this step is 0.06 seconds.                       
   5) We execute the following steps in parallel.                         
        1) We do an all-AMPs JOIN step in TD_Map1 from Spool 19 by way    
           of a RowHash match scan, which is joined to 6884 partitions    
           of D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_CHRG_DTL by way of a RowHash match scan     
           with a condition of ("(D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_CHRG_DTL.ENCTR_ID >= 1) 
           AND ((D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_CHRG_DTL.NAME_SPACE_CD = 'EPIC_TC-153')  
           AND (D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_CHRG_DTL.POST_DT <= DATE '2025-09-04'))").
           Spool 19 and D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_CHRG_DTL are joined using a       
           sliding-window merge join, with a join condition of (          
           "(NAME_SPACE_CD = D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_CHRG_DTL.NAME_SPACE_CD) AND  
           ((D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_CHRG_DTL.ENCTR_ID = ENCTR_ID) AND            
           (D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_CHRG_DTL.POST_DT <= CALENDAR_DATE ))").  The  
           input table D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_CHRG_DTL will not be cached in     
           memory.  The result goes into Spool 20 (all_amps), which is    
           built locally on the AMPs.  Then we do a SORT to partition     
           Spool 20 by rowkey.  The size of Spool 20 is estimated with    
           no confidence to be 24,505 rows (10,610,665 bytes).  The       
           estimated time for this step is 54.69 seconds.                 
        2) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_MAP1 from                
           D_SHR_INT.TERM_MAP_GRP_FLTN by way of an all-rows scan with a  
           condition of ("(D_SHR_INT.TERM_MAP_GRP_FLTN.EFF_END_DT >=      
           DATE '2025-09-04') AND                                         
           ((D_SHR_INT.TERM_MAP_GRP_FLTN.TGT_FMLY_NAME =                  
           'ChargeDepartmentGroup') AND                                   
           (D_SHR_INT.TERM_MAP_GRP_FLTN.EFF_STRT_DT <= DATE               
           '2025-09-04'))") into Spool 21 (all_amps), which is            
           redistributed by hash code to all AMPs in TD_Map1.  The size   
           of Spool 21 is estimated with low confidence to be 32,326      
           rows (5,172,160 bytes).  The estimated time for this step is   
           18.40 seconds.                                                 
   6) We do an all-AMPs JOIN step in TD_Map1 from Spool 20 (Last Use) by  
      way of an all-rows scan, which is joined to a single partition of   
      D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_PRCS_CNTRL with a condition of (                    
      "D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_PRCS_CNTRL.NAME_SPACE_CD = 'EPIC_TC-153'") with a  
      residual condition of (                                             
      "(((D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_PRCS_CNTRL.STD_GRPG_RSULT_DT IS NULL) OR

      '2041-01-01') END ))>= DATE '2025-09-04')) AND                      
      (D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_PRCS_CNTRL.NAME_SPACE_CD = 'EPIC_TC-153')").       
      Spool 20 and D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_PRCS_CNTRL are joined using a          
      rowkey-based inclusion merge join, with a join condition of (       
      "(NAME_SPACE_CD = 'EPIC_TC-153') AND                                
      ((D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_PRCS_CNTRL.NAME_SPACE_CD = NAME_SPACE_CD) AND     
      (D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_PRCS_CNTRL.ENCTR_ID = ENCTR_ID ))").  The result   
      goes into Spool 22 (all_amps), which is redistributed by hash code  
      to all AMPs in TD_Map1.  The size of Spool 22 is estimated with no  
      confidence to be 24,505 rows (9,973,535 bytes).  The estimated      
      time for this step is 0.21 seconds.                                 
   7) We do an all-AMPs JOIN step in TD_Map1 from Spool 21 (Last Use) by  
      way of an all-rows scan, which is joined to Spool 22 (Last Use) by  
      way of an all-rows scan.  Spool 21 and Spool 22 are right outer     
      joined using a single partition hash join, with a join condition    
      of ("(RVNU_DEPT_CD = SRC_TERM_KEY) AND ((CALENDAR_DATE >=           
      EFF_STRT_DT) AND (CALENDAR_DATE <= EFF_END_DT ))").  The result     
      goes into Spool 24 (all_amps) fanned out into 2 hash join           
      partitions, which is redistributed by hash code to all AMPs in      
      TD_Map1.  The size of Spool 24 is estimated with no confidence to   
      be 24,505 rows (9,115,860 bytes).  The estimated time for this      
      step is 0.13 seconds.                                               
   8) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_MAP1 from                     
      D_SHR_INT.TERM_MAP_GRP_FLTN by way of an all-rows scan with a       
      condition of ("(D_SHR_INT.TERM_MAP_GRP_FLTN.EFF_END_DT >= DATE

      DATE '2025-09-04'))") locking for access into Spool 26 (all_amps)   
      fanned out into 2 hash join partitions, which is redistributed by

      way of an all-rows scan, which is joined to Spool 26 (Last Use) by  
      way of an all-rows scan.  Spool 24 and Spool 26 are left outer

      estimated with no confidence to be 24,505 rows (7,400,510 bytes).   
      The estimated time for this step is 0.34 seconds.                   
  12) We execute the following steps in parallel.

      way of an all-rows scan, which is joined to Spool 33 by way of an

  14) We do an all-AMPs SUM step in TD_Map1 to aggregate from Spool 15    
      (Last Use) by way of an all-rows scan, and the grouping identifier  
      in field 1.  Aggregate intermediate results are computed globally,

      The estimated time for this step is 0.02 seconds.                   
  15) We execute the following steps in parallel.                         
       1) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_Map1 from Spool 35 (Last

          step is 0.01 seconds.                                           
       2) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_MAP1 from a single

      (Last Use) by way of an all-rows scan, and the grouping identifier  
      in field 1.  Aggregate intermediate results are computed globally,

       1) We do an all-AMPs JOIN step in TD_Map1 from Spool 62 (Last      
          Use) by way of a RowHash match scan, which is joined to Spool

          locking for access into Spool 69 (all_amps), which is           
          redistributed by hash code to all AMPs in TD_Map1.  Then we do

      "(ENCTR_ID = D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_TSACTN_DTL.ENCTR_ID) AND               
      (NAME_SPACE_CD = D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_TSACTN_DTL.NAME_SPACE_CD)").  The  
      input table D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_TSACTN_DTL will not be cached in        
      memory.  The result goes into Spool 107 (all_amps) fanned out into  
      2 hash join partitions, which is redistributed by hash code to all  
      AMPs in TD_Map1.  The size of Spool 107 is estimated with no        
      confidence to be 10,309 rows (10,453,326 bytes).  The estimated     
      time for this step is 52.83 seconds.                                
  43) We do an all-AMPs JOIN step in TD_Map1 from Spool 97 (Last Use) by  
      way of an all-rows scan, which is joined to Spool 107 (Last Use)    
      by way of an all-rows scan.  Spool 97 and Spool 107 are             
      right outer joined using a hash join of 2 partitions, with a join   
      condition of ("(FRTH_INSRNC_CD = SRC_TERM_KEY) AND ((CALENDAR_DATE  
      <= EFF_END_DT) AND (CALENDAR_DATE >= EFF_STRT_DT ))").  The result  
      goes into Spool 110 (all_amps) fanned out into 50 hash join         
      partitions, which is redistributed by hash code to all AMPs in      
      TD_Map1.  The size of Spool 110 is estimated with no confidence to  
      be 10,309 rows (10,092,511 bytes).  The estimated time for this     
      step is 0.24 seconds.                                               
  44) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_MAP1 from                     
      D_SHR_INT.TERM_MAP_GRP by way of an all-rows scan with no residual  
      conditions into Spool 113 (all_amps) fanned out into 50 hash join   
      partitions, which is redistributed by hash code to all AMPs in      
      TD_Map1.  The size of Spool 113 is estimated with high confidence   
      to be 23,552,166 rows (4,404,255,042 bytes).  The estimated time    
      for this step is 1.49 seconds.                                      
  45) We do an all-AMPs JOIN step in TD_Map1 from Spool 110 (Last Use)    
      by way of an all-rows scan, which is joined to Spool 113 (Last      
      Use) by way of an all-rows scan.  Spool 110 and Spool 113 are       
      left outer joined using a hash join of 50 partitions, with          
      condition(s) used for non-matching on left table ("NOT              
      (ITEM_TSACTN_CD IS NULL)"), with a join condition of (              
      "ITEM_TSACTN_CD = SRC_TERM_KEY").  The result goes into Spool 14    
      (all_amps), which is built locally on the AMPs.  The size of Spool  
      14 is estimated with no confidence to be 11,085 rows (10,874,385    
      bytes).  The estimated time for this step is 0.04 seconds.          
  46) We do an all-AMPs SUM step in TD_Map1 to aggregate from Spool 14    
      (Last Use) by way of an all-rows scan, and the grouping identifier  
      in field 1.  Aggregate intermediate results are computed globally,  
      then placed in Spool 115 in TD_Map1.  The size of Spool 115 is      
      estimated with no confidence to be 10,308 rows (3,381,024 bytes).   
      The estimated time for this step is 0.02 seconds.                   
  47) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_Map1 from Spool 115 (Last     
      Use) by way of an all-rows scan into Spool 7 (used to materialize   
      view, derived table, table function or table operator               
      COMBINED_TERM_CHRG) (all_amps), which is built locally on the AMPs. 
      The size of Spool 7 is estimated with no confidence to be 10,308    
      rows (1,298,808 bytes).  The estimated time for this step is 0.01   
      seconds.                                                            
  48) We do an all-AMPs RETRIEVE step in TD_Map1 from Spool 7 (Last Use)  
      by way of an all-rows scan with a condition of (                    
      "(COMBINED_TERM_CHRG.ENCTR_ID >= 1) AND                             
      ((COMBINED_TERM_CHRG.NAME_SPACE_CD = 'EPIC_TC-153') AND             
      (COMBINED_TERM_CHRG.EFF_FROM_DT = DATE '2025-09-04'))") into Spool  
      119 (all_amps), which is redistributed by hash code to all AMPs in  
      TD_Map1.  Then we do a SORT to order Spool 119 by row hash.  The    
      size of Spool 119 is estimated with no confidence to be 10,308      
      rows (804,024 bytes).  The estimated time for this step is 0.01     
      seconds.                                                            
  49) We do an all-AMPs JOIN step in TD_Map1 from Spool 19 (Last Use) by  
      way of a RowHash match scan, which is joined to Spool 119 (Last     
      Use) by way of a RowHash match scan.  Spool 19 and Spool 119 are    
      left outer joined using a merge join, with a join condition of (    
      "(ENCTR_ID = ENCTR_ID) AND ((NAME_SPACE_CD = NAME_SPACE_CD) AND     
      (EFF_FROM_DT = CALENDAR_DATE ))").  The result goes into Spool 120  
      (all_amps), which is built locally on the AMPs.  Then we do a SORT  
      to partition Spool 120 by rowkey.  The size of Spool 120 is         
      estimated with no confidence to be 91,465 rows (7,317,200 bytes).   
      The estimated time for this step is 0.01 seconds.                   
  50) We do an all-AMPs JOIN step in TD_Map1 from Spool 120 (Last Use)    
      by way of an all-rows scan, which is joined to a single partition   
      of D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_PRCS_CNTRL with a condition of (                 
      "D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_PRCS_CNTRL.NAME_SPACE_CD = 'EPIC_TC-153'") with a  
      residual condition of (

      D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_PRCS_CNTRL for access.  Spool 120 and               
      D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_PRCS_CNTRL are joined using a rowkey-based          
      inclusion merge join, with a join condition of (                    
      "(D_ERM_INT.ENCTR_PRCS_CNTRL.ENCTR_ID = ENCTR_ID) AND

      ((ENCTR_ID >= 1) AND (NAME_SPACE_CD = 'EPIC_TC-153')))").  The      
      result goes into Spool 8 (used to materialize view, derived table,  
      table function or table operator MAIN) (all_amps), which is built   
      locally on the AMPs.  The size of Spool 8 is estimated with no      
      confidence to be 22,900 rows (1,923,600 bytes).  The estimated      
      time for this step is 0.00 seconds.                                 
  51) We do an all-AMPs SUM step in TD_Map1 to aggregate from Spool 8     
      (Last Use) by way of an all-rows scan with a condition of (         
      "MAIN.ENCTR_ID >= 1"), and the grouping identifier in field 1.      
      Aggregate intermediate results are computed globally, then placed   
      in Spool 9 in TD_Map1.  The size of Spool 9 is estimated with no    
      confidence to be 22,900 rows (5,450,200 bytes).  The estimated      
      time for this step is 0.02 seconds.                                 
  52) Finally, we send out an END TRANSACTION step to all AMPs involved   
      in processing the request.                                          
   -> The contents of Spool 9 are sent back to the user as the result of  
      statement 1.
